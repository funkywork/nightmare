(** Since [Nightmare_service] [Endpoints] are typed, [Redirect] provides a
    utility for constructing {i type-safe} redirections.

    For example, consider this [Endpoint]:

    {[
      let my_endpoint () =
        let open Nightmare_service.Endpoint in
        get (~/"foo" / "bar" /: int /: string /: bool)
      ;;
    ]}

    It is possible to construct a redirection {i Ã  la Dream} in this way:

    {[
      Nightmare_dream.Redirect.run my_endpoint 10 "foo" false
    ]}

    As the [Endpoint] holds a continuation the parameters to be passed to the
    {!:val:run} function are defined by the type of the [Endpoint].

    In addition, in accordance with the [Dream] documentation, it is possible to
    optionally specify a status, HTTP code and header list, as well as an anchor
    and additional GET parameters.

    Beware, however, that a redirection can only act on an [Endpoint] whose
    method is [GET]. Using [run] on an endpoint attached to another method will
    cause a compile-time error. *)

(** [run ?status ?code ?headers ?anchor ?parameters endpoint] returns a function
    that waits to be provisioned by the variables defined by the [Endpoint] and
    a request. *)
