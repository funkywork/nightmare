(** An {{!type:t} endpoint} is the conjunction of three components: a [scope], a
    {{!type:Method.t} method} and a {{!type:Path.t} path}. The [scope] describes
    whether the endpoint points to a service (so it {b can be interpreted}) and
    is referred to as an [Inner endpoint] or whether the endpoint points to an
    external resource (which {b cannot be interpreted}) and is referred to as an
    [Outer endpoint].

    Endpoints are defined separately, uncoupled from their controllers so that
    they can be used between different controllers to build links between them
    without suffering from complicated mutual recursions. *)

(** {1 types}

    An endpoint is set up with 4 types:

    - ['scope] which can be [ `Inner] or [`Outer], describing whether the
      endpoint can be interpreted or not
    - ['method] which is always of type {!type:Method.t}
    - ['continuation] and ['witness] which are the two parameters of the
      {!type:Path.t} used to describe the path *)

(** The type describing an [endpoint]. *)
type ('scope, 'method_, 'continuation, 'witness) t

(** A [wrapped] endpoint is wrapped in a [unit -> t] function to avoid the value
    restriction. *)

type ('scope, 'method_, 'continuation, 'witness) wrapped =
  unit -> ('scope, 'method_, 'continuation, 'witness) t

(** {1 Constructing inner endpoint}

    The construction of an [inner endpoint] is simply the association between a
    {!type:Method.t} and {!type:Path.t}. *)

(** [get path] builds an [inner endpoint] for the [GET] method attached to the
    given [path]. *)
val get
  :  ('continuation, 'witness) Path.t
  -> ([> `Inner ], [> `GET ], 'continuation, 'witness) t

(** [post path] builds an [inner endpoint] for the [POST] method attached to the
    given [path]. *)
val post
  :  ('continuation, 'witness) Path.t
  -> ([> `Inner ], [> `POST ], 'continuation, 'witness) t

(** [put path] builds an [inner endpoint] for the [PUT] method attached to the
    given [path]. *)
val put
  :  ('continuation, 'witness) Path.t
  -> ([> `Inner ], [> `PUT ], 'continuation, 'witness) t

(** [delete path] builds an [inner endpoint] for the [DELETE] method attached to
    the given [path]. *)
val delete
  :  ('continuation, 'witness) Path.t
  -> ([> `Inner ], [> `DELETE ], 'continuation, 'witness) t

(** [head path] builds an [inner endpoint] for the [HEAD] method attached to the
    given [path]. *)
val head
  :  ('continuation, 'witness) Path.t
  -> ([> `Inner ], [> `HEAD ], 'continuation, 'witness) t

(** [connect path] builds an [inner endpoint] for the [CONNECT] method attached
    to the given [path]. *)
val connect
  :  ('continuation, 'witness) Path.t
  -> ([> `Inner ], [> `CONNECT ], 'continuation, 'witness) t

(** [options path] builds an [inner endpoint] for the [OPTIONS] method attached
    to the given [path]. *)
val options
  :  ('continuation, 'witness) Path.t
  -> ([> `Inner ], [> `OPTIONS ], 'continuation, 'witness) t

(** [trace path] builds an [inner endpoint] for the [TRACE] method attached to
    the given [path]. *)
val trace
  :  ('continuation, 'witness) Path.t
  -> ([> `Inner ], [> `TRACE ], 'continuation, 'witness) t

(** [patch path] builds an [inner endpoint] for the [PATCH] method attached to
    the given [path]. *)
val patch
  :  ('continuation, 'witness) Path.t
  -> ([> `Inner ], [> `PATCH ], 'continuation, 'witness) t

(** {2 Examples}

    The definition of an endpoint is simply to describe a function that takes
    [unit] and returns a {!type:t}. (Since an endpoint can be used in multiple
    place and the second parameter, ['witness] is fixed by the usage, for
    example, the ['witness] can vary if you want to generate a link (it will
    return a [string]) or interpret a [path] as a route which will return a
    [http response]. So in order to avoid an early type-fixing, we wrap an
    endpoint into a function from [unit] to {!type:t}.)

    {[
      let my_first_endpoint () = get (~/"hello" / "world")
      let an_other_endpoint () = post (~/"hello" /: string)
    ]} *)

(** {1 Constructing outer endpoint}

    An [outer endpoint] is just a prefix, for example ["https://mon-site.com"]
    associated with a method and a path. For simplicity, you can lift an
    [inner endpoint] to an [outer endpoint] using the {!val:outer} function. *)

(** [outer inner_f prefix path] build a [outer endpoint]. The [inner_f] is one
    of the function {!val:get}, {!val:post}, {!val:put}, {!val:delete},
    {!val:patch}, {!val:head}, {!val:connect}, {!val:options}, {!val:trace}. *)
val outer
  :  (('continuation, 'witness) Path.t
      -> ([ `Inner ], 'method_, 'continuation, 'witness) t)
  -> string
  -> ('continuation, 'witness) Path.t
  -> ([> `Outer ], 'method_, 'continuation, 'witness) t

(** {2 Examples}

    Although the signature may be intimidating, building an [outer endpoint] is
    really simple! Let's say I wanted to go to a github profile, I could simply
    describe its endpoint like this:

    {[
      let github_profile () = outer get "https://github.com" ~/:string
    ]} *)

(** {1 Link generation and pretty-printing}

    As seen in the {!module:Path}, the way a path is constructed allows it to be
    used bi-directionally. Overall, the generation of a link or target does not
    do much more, except that it prohibits certain generations. For example,
    since HTML only allows [GET] hyperlinks (whose tag attribute is [href]), it
    is impossible (it's typechecked) to create a URL for a [<a>] using the
    functions related to [href] generation. *)

(** [href ?anchor ?parameters endpoint] will return a function that need all
    defined variables into the path burried into the endpoint and will produce a
    corresponding string adding [anchor] and [get parameters] (if they are
    defined).
    {b this function works only for [GET] endpoints ([Inner] or [Outer])}
    because HTML links only admit [GET] request.*)
val href
  :  ?anchor:string
  -> ?parameters:(string * string) list
  -> (_, [< Method.for_link ], 'continuation, string) wrapped
  -> 'continuation

(** [href_with ?anchor ?parameters endpoint handler] will return a function that
    need all defined variables into the path and will produce a corresponding
    string adding [anchor] and [get parameters] (if they are defined) and apply
    [handler] tot that produced string.

    This function is, like {!val:Path.sprintf_with} useful if you want to apply
    a finalizer to the output of a path that has not yet been completely
    calculated. For example, {!val:href} is a specialized version of
    [href_with]:

    {[
      let href ?anchor ?parameters endpoint =
        href_with ?anchor ?parameters endpoint (fun x -> x)
      ;;
    ]}

    {b As with {!val:href}, the function can only be used for [GET] endpoints
    ([Inner] or [Outer]).} *)
val href_with
  :  ?anchor:string
  -> ?parameters:(string * string) list
  -> (_, [< Method.for_link ], 'continuation, 'witness) wrapped
  -> (string -> 'witness)
  -> 'continuation

(** [form_method endpoint] will returns the method of a form.
    {b Since HTML form can just handle [GET] and [POST] form, the function can
    just take those as an argument}. *)
val form_method
  :  (_, Method.for_form_action, _, _) wrapped
  -> [> Method.for_form_action ]

(** [form_action ?anchor ?parameters endpoint] will return a function that need
    all defined variables into the path burried into the endpoint and will
    produce a corresponding string adding [anchor] and [get parameters] (if they
    are defined).
    {b this function works only for [GET] and [POST] endpoints ([Inner] or
    [Outer])} because HTML form only admit [GET] or [POST] request.*)
val form_action
  :  ?anchor:string
  -> ?parameters:(string * string) list
  -> (_, [< Method.for_form_action ], 'continuation, string) wrapped
  -> 'continuation

(** [form_action_with ?anchor ?parameters endpoint handler] will return a
    function that need all defined variables into the path and will produce a
    corresponding string adding [anchor] and [get parameters] (if they are
    defined) and apply [handler] tot that produced string.

    This function is, like {!val:Path.sprintf_with} useful if you want to apply
    a finalizer to the output of a path that has not yet been completely
    calculated. For example, {!val:form_action} is a specialized version of
    [form_action_with] *)
val form_action_with
  :  ?anchor:string
  -> ?parameters:(string * string) list
  -> (_, [< Method.for_form_action ], 'continuation, 'witness) wrapped
  -> (string -> 'witness)
  -> 'continuation

(** [gen_link] is like [href_with] but with relexed constraints on methods.*)
val gen_link
  :  ?anchor:string
  -> ?parameters:(string * string) list
  -> (_, [< Method.t ], 'continuation, 'witness) wrapped
  -> (string -> 'witness)
  -> 'continuation

(** {1 Scanning and interpreting}

    After being able to generate links (for [a] tags or as a form action) it is
    also possible to interpret [endpoint]. As with the {!val:Path.sscanf}
    function, {!val:sscanf} allows you to interpret an [endpoint] by ensuring
    that the method given as an argument matches the method attached to the
    [endpoint].

    {b Interpretation is only possible for [Inner endpoints], logically, what
    sense does it make to try to interpret a route that is not served by the
    application} *)

(** [sscanf endpooint given_method given_uri handler] will perform [handler]
    (provisioned with the extracted variables) if the given method matches the
    one buried in the endpoint and return its result wrapped in a [Some], if the
    endpoint is not a candidate, it will return [None].*)
val sscanf
  :  ([ `Inner ], Method.t, 'continuation, 'witness) wrapped
  -> Method.t
  -> string
  -> 'continuation
  -> 'witness option

(** {1 Re-export of path components}

    The [Endpoint] module re-exports helpers from {!module:Path} so that the
    [Endpoint] opening is sufficient to build the [Endpoint] and the [Path]
    without having to couple the local openings.

    {2 Infix operators} *)

module Infix = Path.Infix

include module type of Path.Infix (** @closed*)

(** {2 Preset variables} *)

module Variables = Path.Preset

include module type of Path.Preset (** @closed *)

(** {2 Other helpers} *)

(** [root] returns the root of a {{!type:t} path}. Every path starts with a
    root. *)
val root : ('witness, 'witness) Path.t

(** [method_of enpoint] returns the method of the endpoint. *)
val method_of : (_, Method.t, _, _) wrapped -> [> Method.t ]
