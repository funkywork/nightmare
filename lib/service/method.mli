(** Deal with common HTTP methods. Associated with a {!type:Path.t}, we can
    describe endpoints to build internal and external links. *)

(** {1 types}

    The set of methods supported by Nightmare are described in polymorphic
    variants that are unified in {!type:t}. This allows methods to be
    intersected, particularly to index certain types more finely. *)

(** See
    {{:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods} MDN Web
    documentation} for more information about [HTTP request methods]. *)
type t =
  [ `GET (** Requests a representation of the specified resource. *)
  | `POST (** Submits an entity to the specified resource. *)
  | `PUT
    (** Replaces all current representations of the target resource with the
        request payload. *)
  | `DELETE (** Deletes the specified resource. *)
  | `HEAD (** Like [GET] but without the response body. *)
  | `CONNECT
    (** Makes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource. *)
  | `OPTIONS (** Describes the communication options for the target resource. *)
  | `TRACE
    (** Performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource. *)
  | `PATCH (** Applies partial modifications to a resource. *)
  ]

(** {2 Specialized methods}

    Despite the diversity of HTTP methods, it is not possible to make hyperlinks
    that do more than [GET] and forms can only be [GET] or [POST]. *)

(** A type for the methods accepted by the links. *)
type for_link = [ `GET ]

(** A type for methods accepted as a method of a form. *)
type for_form_action =
  [ `GET
  | `POST
  ]

(** {1 Utils} *)

(** Equality between {!type:t}. *)
val equal : t -> t -> bool

(** Pretty printer for {!type:t}. *)
val pp : Format.formatter -> t -> unit

(** [to_string meth] will render a {!type:t} into an uppercased string. *)
val to_string : t -> string

(** [from_string str] try to find the corresponding method for a given string. *)
val from_string : string -> t option

(** Returns a list of all supported methods. *)
val all : t list
